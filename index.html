        <h1>Behold Dwarka: The gateway to heaven</h1>
        <p>In the embrace of the boundless Arabian Sea, lies the ancient city of Dwarka, built by the divine hands of Lord Krishna himself. Here, amidst the ebb and flow of time, pilgrims find solace in its spirituality, for Dwarka is one of the four sacred Hindu pilgrimage sites called the Char Dham.</p>

        <p>It is this legend that makes Dwarka (also known as Devbhumi Dwarka) a crown jewel for Gujarat, because not only is it home to the stunning Dwarkadhish temple, it is also a marine archaeological marvel. Offshore excavations have revealed the remnants of an ancient city dating back to 2000 BC. Excavated relics, such as ancient stone anchors, offer compelling evidence of Dwarka’s pivotal role in the trade between India and Arabia from the 15th to the 18th centuries. Evidently, Dwarka was a significant trade port at that time, serving as a crucial gateway for foreign sailors venturing into India.</p>
